If, then, else
Well, this one is a basic one, and in fact we already used this structure in the previous chapter. Consider the following structure, where E is an expression and S1 and S2 are statements (they may be compound statements like { SA; SB; SC; })

if (E) then
   S1
else
   S2
A possible way to express this in ARM assembler could be the following

if_eval: 
    /* Assembler that evaluates E and updates the cpsr accordingly */
bXX else /* Here XX is the appropiate condition */
then_part: 
   /* assembler for S1, the "then" part */
   b end_of_if
else:
   /* assembler for S2, the "else" part */
end_of_if:
If there is no else part, we can replace bXX else with bXX end_of_if.

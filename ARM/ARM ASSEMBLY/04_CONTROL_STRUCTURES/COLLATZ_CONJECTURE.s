//3n+1
//Letâ€™s make another example a bit more complicated. This is the famous 
//3n + 1 problem also known as the Collatz conjecture. 
//Given a number n we will divide it by 2 if it is even and multiply it by 3 and add one if it is odd.

//Collatz conjecture states that, for any number n, 
//repeatedly applying this procedure will eventually give us the number 1
